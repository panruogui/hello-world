# hello-world
this is my first repository to practice
I'm sitting in 203 laboraotry when I write down these words
I want to learn how to use Github by the guide
I have thought mant days about if I should give up graduate school.Nowadays,the ieda of dropping out is getting stronger and stronger.There are some reasons which dirves me,first,beacuse I have colour weakness which is unfavourable to find a job in Electrical industry,I am not very willing to continue to study.Second,I think I am able to study in a better university by taking the postgraduate entrance examination again.Besides,Considering I did not do my best to prepare during my first try of postgraduate entrance examination,I am confident to get a satisfactory score if I try it again by choosing a suitable goal.But I do not know how to talk about this thing in the face of my tutor
